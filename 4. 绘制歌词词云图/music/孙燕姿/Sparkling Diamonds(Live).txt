A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
A kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rental on your humble flat
Or help you feed your helpless cat
Men grow cold as girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
But square cut or pear shape these rocks don't fluid their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Tiffany!
Cartier!
Cause we are living in a material world and I am a material girl
Come and get me boys
Black star, Ross Cole talk to my Harry Zidler, tell me all about it!
There are may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girls best friend
There may come a time when a hard-worked employer thinks you're
Awful nice
But get that ice or else on dice
He's your guy when fights are high so beware when they start to say
Diamonds are a girl's best
Diamonds are a girl's best
Diamonds are a girl's best friends
Let's make love
Yes! Yes! Tiger!
EVERYTHING'S GOING SO WELL!
Cause that's when those louses go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friends
