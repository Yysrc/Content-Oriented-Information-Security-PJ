作词 : 廖莹如/孙燕姿
 作曲 : 孙燕姿
my hair was long & shining
you said you can't believe
how could walk our that door
or walk along the streets
you told me I should you know
do some bing bang curly wurly afro thing
I took your word & did
looked in my mirror
who's that freak
why does the world deceive
why do I make believe
took my heel & made
achilles out of me still
so I won't wanna be
someone who's answer to me
someone who sees like a child
give like a saint
feel like an angel
never mind the broken wings
and speak like a picture
cry like the rain
shine like the star
as long as the fire remains

the vase beside my bed
it's empty a most dead
it's for all the flowers I'm gonna give you he said
and now it's collecting qust instead

why does the world deceive
why do I make believe
took my heel & made
achilles out of me still
so I won't wanna be
someone who's answer to me
someone who sees like a child
give like a saint
feel like an angel
never mind the broken wings
and speak like a picture
cry like the rain
shine like the star
as long as the fire remains

sees like a child
give like a saint
feel like an angel
never mind the broken wings
and speak like a picture
cry like the rain
shine like the star
as long as the fire remains作词 : 廖莹如/孙燕姿
