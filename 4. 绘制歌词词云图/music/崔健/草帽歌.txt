Ma Ma do you remember，
the old straw hat you gave to me，
I lost that hat long ago，
flew to the foggy canyon.
Yeh Ma ma I wonder
what happened to that old straw hat，
falling down the mountain side
out of my reach like your heart.
Suddenly that wind came up，
stealing my hat from me yeh.
Swirling whirling gust of wind，
blowing it higher away.
Ma ma that old straw hat
was the only one I really loved，
but we lost it.
No one could bring it back，
like the life you gave me.
Suddenly that wind came up，
stealing my hat from me yeh.
Swirling whirling gust of wind，
blowing it higher away.
Ma ma that old straw hat
was the only one I really loved，
but we lost it.
No one could bring it back，
like the life you gave me.
