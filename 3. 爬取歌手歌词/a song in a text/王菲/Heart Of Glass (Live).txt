Once i had a love and it was a gas, soon turned out had a heart of glass.
Seemed like the real thing, only to find mucho mistrust.
Love's gone behind.
Once i had a love and it was divine.
Soon found out i was losing my mind.
It seemed like the real thing but i was so blind.
Mucho mistrust.
Love's gone behind.
In between \what i find is pleasing\ and \i'm feeling fine\, love is so confusing.
There's no peace of mind if i fear i'm losing you.
It's just no good, you teasing like you do.

We coulda made it cruising, yeah.

Ooh ooh ooh whoa.
Ooh ooh ooh whoa.
