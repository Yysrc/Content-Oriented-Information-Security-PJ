Just the other day I heard your voices right by here
Maybe it's all in my head but still I feel you near
All the memories of your faces
Seem like days of yore
And if the walls are closing in
We'll find a window deep within
I'll stay with you
Till the rays come through
Till we find a way and we'd say
Look what time has held true
Stay with you
We will all come through
Till we find a way me and you
We'd gather our dreams again
Come round I'll be here
Right with you
Just the other day I heard your voices right by here
Maybe it's all in my head but still I feel you near
All the memories of your faces
Seem like days of yore
And if the walls are closing in
We'll find a window deep within
I'll stay with you
Till the rays come through
Till we find a way and we'd say
Look what time has held true
Stay with you
We will all come through
Till we find a way me and you
We'd gather our dreams again
Come round I'll be here
Right with you
I'll stay with you
Till the rays come through
Till we find a way and we'd say
Look what time has held true
Stay with you
We will all come through
Till we find a way me and you
We'd gather all our dreams again
We may not all be the same
But come round I'll be here, right with you
