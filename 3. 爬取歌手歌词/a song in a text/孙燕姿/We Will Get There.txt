Remember the days'
We sat out together with faith?
Remember the times' so fine'
When we thought that nothing could stand in our way?
Then things weren't the same'
The life that we knew had to change
We've struggled through the darkest storms'
We thought we couldn't tame
Together we've tried'
As we stood side by side
I knew we'd build a new world'
A world of hope forever after
Deep in my heart I just know'
right from the start we will grow
Look where we are'
we've come so far and there's still a long long way to go
with All of my heart' I will care.
I'll play my part' I will share
With family and friends'together we'll stand
And in the end' hand in hand'
We will get there
So now we begin' working together to win
Believing in trust' it must be possible to overcome anything.
There's so much to do'
There's so much we can contribute
By sharing just a little love'
We will start again a new
So why don't we try?
If we stand side by side
I know we'll build a new world'
A world of hope for ever after
Deep in my heart I just know'
right from the start we will grow
Look where we are'
we've come so far and there's still a long long way to go
All of my heart' I will care.
I'll play my part' I will share
With family and friends'together we'll stand
And in the end' hand in hand'
We will get there
All of my heart' I will care.
And in the end' hand in hand'
We will get there
