wo   yes wait a minute Mr. postman
Wai-ai-ai-ait Mr. postman

oh yeah  Please
Mr. postman oh yeah

There must be some mail today-ay-ay
From my boyfriend so far away
Please Mr. postman look and see
If there's a letter a letter for me.
I've been standing here waiting Mr. postman
So-o-o patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying he's returning home to me.
Mr. Postman  oh yeah
Please Mr. postman oh yeah

So many days you passed me by-y-y
See the tear standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter
Mr. postman oh yeah
Please Mr. postman what let me shaken and see
one more time for me
Wait a minute, wait a minute,

Wait a minute, wait a minute, Mr. postman
Come on you leave me the letter
The sooner the better

Mr postman
