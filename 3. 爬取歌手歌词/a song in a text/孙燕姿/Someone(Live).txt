my hair was long & shining
you said you can＇t believe
how could walk our that door
or walk along the streets
you told me I should you know
do some bing bang curly wurly afro thing
I took your word & did
looked in my mirror
who＇s that freak
why does the world deceive
why do I make believe
took my heel & made
achilles out of me still
so I won＇t wanna be
someone who＇s answer to me
someone who sees like a child
give like a saint
feel like an angel
never mind the broken wings
and speak like a picture
cry like the rain
shine like the star
as long as the fire remains
the vase beside my bed
it＇s empty a most dead
it＇s for all the flowers I＇m gonna give you he said
and now it＇s collecting dust instead
why does the world deceive
why do I make believe
took my heel & made
achilles out of me still
so I won＇t wanna be
someone who＇s answer to me
someone who sees like a child
give like a saint
feel like an angel
never mind the broken wings
and speak like a picture
cry like the rain
shine like the star
as long as the fire remains
sees like a child
give like a saint
feel like an angel
never mind the broken wings
and speak like a picture
cry like the rain
shine like the star
as long as the fire remains
