Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker
You heart breaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way
Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting around the bend
My huckleberry friend, Moon River
And me
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting around the bend
My huckleberry friend, Moon River
And me
