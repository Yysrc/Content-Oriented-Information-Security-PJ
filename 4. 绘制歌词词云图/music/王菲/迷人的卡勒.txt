you,in my heart
in my dreams
in my crazy world that night
in your time
in your life
in your fantasy
carry long,don't play that melody
carry long,I few for you
carry long,where is my better sea
carry long,please love me ture
I,in your eyes，any time，any where.
I think of you, take my heart in your hands with my fantasy
carry long,don't play that melody
carry long,I few for you
carry long,where is my better sea
carry long,please love me ture
carry long,don't play that melody
carry long,I few for you
carry long,where is my better sea
carry long,please love me ture
carry long,don't play that melody
