Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don\'t they know it\'s the end of the world
Cause you don\'t love me anymore
Why does the birds go on singing?
Why does the stars glow above?
Don\'t they know it\'s the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love
I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everying\'s the same as it was
I can\'t understand, no, I can\'t understand
How life goes on the way it does
Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do the eyes of my cry?
Don\'t they know it\'s the end of the world
It ended when you say goodbye
Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don\'t they know it\'s the end of the world
Cause you don\'t love me anymore
Why does the birds go on singing?
Why does the stars glow above?
Don\'t they know it\'s the end of the world
Cause you don\'t love me anymore
I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everying\'s the same as it was
I can\'t understand, no, I can\'t understand
How life goes on the way it does
Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do the eyes of my cry?
Don\'t they know it\'s the end of the world
It ended when you say goodbye
