He's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky

He's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see his face
He takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Oh, Sweet child o' mine
Oh oh oh oh, Sweet love of mine

He's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
His hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by
Oh, Sweet child o' mine
Oh oh oh oh , Sweet love of mine
Oh oh oh, Sweet child o' mine
Baby
Oh oh oh, Sweet love of mine

Oh, Sweet child o' mine
Oh oh oh oh , Sweet love of mine
Oh oh oh, Sweet child o' mine
Baby
Oh oh oh, Sweet love of mine
Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh...
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Where do we go now (Where do we go)
Where do we go now
Where do we go (Where do we go now)
Where do we go now

Sweet child
Sweet love
o' mine
He's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Sweet child
Sweet love
o' mine
